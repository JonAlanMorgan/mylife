Do you find this video entertaining? On one hand, it is amusing to see these—ahem—more seasoned individuals trying new technology for the first time, but on the other I can't help but think that I'll someday find myself in one of these videos reacting to a hologram, or a self-driving car, or a transporter room. I think one constant of the universe is that everything changes. I think that the worse part of growing older may be that you have a memory of how things used to be—and, not everything changes for the best.
