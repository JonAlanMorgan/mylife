# A Look at Ghostbusters

![](streaming-800px (1).png)

“Ghostbusters” was the third biggest thing in my life when I was a kid, overshadowed only by “Star Wars” or perhaps “Transformers.” I didn't see the movie when it came out in theaters. I'm pretty sure my parents were pretty much against it. I do remember my cousin telling me how funny it was when our families got together for Thanksgiving that year. It only made me want to see it even more. I don't believe that I've seen it in the movie theater, so I'm fairly sure the first time I watched it was on TV. I now own the re-releases on DVD.
The most fun thing about “Ghostbusters” was that you could role play your own adventures if you had the right materials. I figured out that almost any backpack could be a proton pack, and almost anything long and slender could be a proton thrower. I even made my own ghost traps at home out of wood. One had the same modular design as the ones from the movie (and the cartoon) allowing you to “flush” a ghost after you've caught it.
I was also a fan of the “Real Ghostbusters” when it was shown on Saturday mornings. I may have gotten the most exposure via the cartoon, and then discovered the movie later.
What are your first memories of “Ghostbusters?”
